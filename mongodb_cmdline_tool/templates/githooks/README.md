# GitHooks

The githooks in this directory are meant to be used with [`the install-hooks script`](https://github.com/guoyr/mongo/blob/9a8b7eab7bc024c004a2a791de556011a1cc1bfa/buildscripts/install-hooks) 
after copying and pasting them into the `~/.githooks/[repo-name]` directory. They can be used with any repository.

### Contributing
The folder names in this directory must correspond to the name of the git hook 
(e.g. `pre-push`, `post-commit`); the names of the scripts should correspond to their content.
